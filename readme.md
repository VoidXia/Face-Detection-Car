# Human Face Tracking Robot Car

This is the project for EI345 at SJTU and the Mathworks Excellance in Innovation program. We've built a human face tracking robot car in two different ways: Detection on Board and Detection on Phone. In addition, we've implemented a Chinese voice controlling system, a trail following system, and an obstacle avoidance system.

See readme in the corresponding folder for detail. The version using Android phone is a revised and more advanced solution.
